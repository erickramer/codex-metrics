# Dashboard Development Tasks

The following tasks are prioritized to implement the metrics dashboard described in `overview.pdf`. Each task should be implemented in a separate pull request and include unit tests where applicable.

1. **Initialize Repository Structure**
   - Create directories for `app`, `tests`, and `data`.
   - Add a basic `pytest` configuration.

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment Configuration**
   - Provide `requirements.txt` with `streamlit` and `plotly`.
   - Include instructions for creating a virtual environment.

3. **Create Streamlit App Skeleton**
   - Add a minimal `app/main.py` that starts a Streamlit app.
   - Display a placeholder title.

4. **Define Metrics Data Model**
   - Create a module to represent metrics (e.g., dataclasses).
   - Include parsing utilities for sample JSON/CSV data.

5. **Implement Data Loading Logic**
   - Add functions to read metrics from local files.
   - Provide unit tests with sample data.
   - *Depends on task 4.*

6. **Basic Metrics Visualization**
   - Use Plotly to display at least one metric chart in Streamlit.
   - *Depends on tasks 3 and 5.*

7. **Interactive Filtering Controls**
   - Add Streamlit widgets to filter metrics by date or category.
   - *Depends on tasks 3 and 6.*

8. **Dashboard Layout and Styling**
   - Organize visuals into a clean layout.
   - Keep the design minimal and functional.

9. **Add Unit Tests for Visualization Functions**
   - Ensure Plotly figures are created with expected data.
   - *Depends on tasks 4â€“7.*

10. **Sample Dataset and Fixtures**
    - Provide small example datasets under `data/` for testing.

11. **Documentation for Running the App**
    - Write `README.md` instructions for setup and execution.

12. **Continuous Integration Configuration**
    - Add a simple CI workflow that runs `pytest` on each PR.

13. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
    - Improve robustness of data loading and user inputs.
    - *Depends on tasks 5 and 7.*

14. **Deployable Streamlit Script**
    - Prepare entry point for deployment (e.g., `streamlit run app/main.py`).
    - Document deployment steps.

15. **Performance Metrics Summary Table**
    - Display a table summarizing key metrics alongside charts.
    - *Depends on tasks 5 and 6.*
