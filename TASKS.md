# Dashboard Development Tasks

The following tasks are prioritized to implement the metrics dashboard described in `overview.pdf`. Each task should be implemented in a separate pull request and include unit tests where applicable.

1. **Initialize Repository Structure**
   - Create directories for `app`, `tests`, and `data`.
   - Add a basic `pytest` configuration.

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment Configuration**
   - Provide `requirements.txt` with `streamlit` and `plotly`.
   - Include instructions for creating a virtual environment.

3. **Create Streamlit App Skeleton**
   - Add a minimal `app/main.py` that starts a Streamlit app.
   - Display a placeholder title.

4. **Define Metrics Data Model**
   - Create a module to represent metrics (e.g., dataclasses).
   - Include parsing utilities for sample JSON/CSV data.

5. **Implement Data Loading Logic**
   Implement a loader for each metric listed in `METRICS.md`. Use small example
   JSON or CSV files under `data/` as inputs.
   5a. **Active Users** – parse GitHub REST search results and aggregate by date
       and repository.
   5b. **Pull Request Count** – read PR listings and count entries grouped by
       repo and language.
   5c. **Commit Count** – ingest commit data referencing Codex and produce a
       daily summary.
   5d. **GitHub Star Growth** – import stargazer stats and calculate growth over
       time.
   5e. **Average Latency** – load telemetry logs and compute mean response time.
   5f. **P95 Latency** – evaluate the 95th percentile of completion latency from
       the same logs.
   5g. **Task Completion Time Distribution** – bucket task runtimes into
       <1m,<5m, etc.
   5h. **System Uptime / Error Rate** – read monitoring data to derive success
       rates.
   5i. **Acceptance Rate** – parse PR states and determine merge percentages.
   5j. **Task Success Rate** – load CI workflow statuses and calculate pass
       rates.
   5k. **Bug / Error Rate** – combine telemetry and feedback metrics for bug
       counts.
   5l. **Benchmark Results** – ingest internal evaluation scores by model.
   5m. **Repository Stars History** – chart star counts per repository over
       time.
   5n. **Open Issues and Pull Requests** – track open/closed volumes by date.
   5o. **Mentions Across GitHub** – pull repository search results and store hit
       counts.
   5p. **Developer Satisfaction / NPS** – read survey results mapped by user
       segment.
   5q. **Support Query Volume** – aggregate support-ticket data by channel and
       date.
   5r. **Renewal / Conversion Rates** – import business metrics per plan type.
   5s. **Percentage of Code Generated by Codex** – parse telemetry to compute
       the share of generated code.
   5t. **Time Savings** – read case study data comparing time with/without
       Codex.
   - Provide unit tests for each loader with sample data.
   - *Depends on task 4.*

6. **Basic Metrics Visualization**
   - Use Plotly to display at least one metric chart in Streamlit.
   - *Depends on tasks 3 and 5.*

7. **Interactive Filtering Controls**
   - Add Streamlit widgets to filter metrics by date or category.
   - *Depends on tasks 3 and 6.*

8. **Dashboard Layout and Styling**
   - Organize visuals into a clean layout.
   - Keep the design minimal and functional.

9. **Add Unit Tests for Visualization Functions**
   - Ensure Plotly figures are created with expected data.
   - *Depends on tasks 4–7.*

10. **Sample Dataset and Fixtures**
    - Provide small example datasets under `data/` for testing.

11. **Documentation for Running the App**
    - Write `README.md` instructions for setup and execution.

12. **Continuous Integration Configuration**
    - Add a simple CI workflow that runs `pytest` on each PR.

13. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
    - Improve robustness of data loading and user inputs.
    - *Depends on tasks 5 and 7.*

14. **Deployable Streamlit Script**
    - Prepare entry point for deployment (e.g., `streamlit run app/main.py`).
    - Document deployment steps.

15. **Performance Metrics Summary Table**
    - Display a table summarizing key metrics alongside charts.
    - *Depends on tasks 5 and 6.*
